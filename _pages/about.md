Hello there, I'm **Jordan Irgang**! I am a software engineer with a passion for robotics, embedded systems, and dynamic control systems. Currently, I am working for [BAE Systems](https://www.baesystems.com/en/home) as a Software Engineer II.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/) My studies have included coursework in digital electronics, robotics, machine design, classical mechanics, and control systems. In 2022, I served as a student ambassador for the [International Convention of Robotics and Automation](https://2025.ieee-icra.org/), recommended by the department's chair. As a software engineer with an academic background in mechanical engineering, I am interested in working on challenging projects that combine my disciplines. 

My most recent project involves creating a [robot arm](fake.com) with inverse kinematics that was created with 3D-printed parts. To see all my projects, please visit my [Projects](/projects/) page.

My skills include programming in Python, C++, C#, C, Bash, Java, and Javascript. In robotics, I have direct experience with ROS2, Gazebo, OpenCV, MediaPipe, YOLOv8, machine learning, controls, and embedded systems. Additionally, I am proficient in Linux, Git, CMake, unit testing, UML diagrams, and MATLAB.  I also have expertise in design and manufacturing and have used Fusion360, Autodesk Inventor, PTC Creo, MultiSim, and CAM and tool paths.
