## Project Use Case 
This is a wearable IoT glove designed to capture finger motion and interface over TCP to hardware. It would be used as a wearable motion controller to be used in an industrial setting so workers could control dangerous hardware without needing to physically touch the machinery.
This project won an award at MakeMIT 2021.

## Project Functionality
An I2c bus for five IMUs stream their accelerometer data to an esp32 running micro python. The esp32 determines if the motion created is a user input and sends over the command via TCP to a Python TCP server which processes the commands. The server was a representation of a smart device. The user could connect to the smart device by inputting the IP address directly into the esp32.

## My Role
-Programmed vector math, I2c interface, accelerometer data acquisition, TCP to web server interface, Unit tests, and simple motion detection, in python for a micropython esp32 .
-Modeled UML Class and Case Diagrams and preliminary CAD model winning us $300 funding for prototype development.

## Next Steps
-Machine learning SVD vector motion finger pose detection would be integrated into the gloves.
-TCP based hardware and smart locks would be made for interaction demonstrations.
-Usage of a flask server to handle http requests for endpoint based functionality.
